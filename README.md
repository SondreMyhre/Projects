# Projects

A small collection of machine learning,  computer vision, and mathematics projects I've built during my MSc in Cybernetics and Robotics at NTNU and on the side.

## Featured projects
- **Njord_Perception** Real-time buoy detection for an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) using ZED stereo camera, YOLOv8, and ROS2.

- **Snow_pole_detection** Mini-project from TDT4265: YOLO-based detection of snow poles using RGB and LiDAR-derived images.

- **blackjack.ipynb** Reinforcement learning agent for OpenAI Gymnasium Blackjack.

- **nevral.ipynb** MLP for MNIST from scratch using only NumPy.

- **pi.ipynb** A small numerical exploration of p-norms:
for a unit ball defined by ‖x‖ = 1, we approximate its perimeter and diameter and compute their ratio (π). The experiment shows that the Euclidean norm minimizes the value π. 

## Notes
Some projects depend on hardware (e.g., ZED camera, ASV platform) or private datasets.
