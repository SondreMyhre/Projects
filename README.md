# Projects

A collection of machine learning,  computer vision, and mathematics projects I've made. 

## Featured projects
- **Njord_Perception** Real-time buoy detection for an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) using ZED stereo camera, YOLOv8, and ROS2. I made this for Njord NTNU, when i was a member. 

- **Snow_pole_detection** Mini-project from TDT4265 (Computer Vision & Deep Learning): YOLO-based detection of snow poles using RGB + LiDAR-derived images. I completed the mini-project with another student, but I did not take the exam.

- **blackjack.ipynb** Training an agent in gymnasium blackjack environment, with reinforcement learning. '

- **nevral.ipynb** Creating a perceptron from scratch only using Pandas and NumPy, and training it on the MNIST dataset.

- **pi.ipynb** Numerically showing that the euclidean norm minimizes pi, when pi is defined as the ratio between circumference and diameter, and circle from all points with equal norm to the centre.

## Notes
Some projects depend on hardware (e.g., ZED camera, ASV platform) or private datasets.
