# Snow Pole Detection – TDT4265 Computer Vision and Deep Learning mini-project

Mini-project built for the subject TDT4265 Computer Vision & Deep Learning.The task was to create a YOLO-based detection of snow poles (brøytestikker) using RGB and Lidar images. We trained our model using NTNUs supercomputer IDUN, and got familiar with SSH and slurm.

## File overview
- **resultsLidar** The best results (YOLO) i got from training the model with Lidar data.
- **resultsRGB** The best results (YOLO) i got from training the model with RGB data.
- **yoloTrain.py** The program used to train a model with YOLO.

## Notes  
I lost most the files i used in this subject, because i had them stored on IDUN and lost them when i lost permission.
